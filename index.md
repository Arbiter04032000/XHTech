## Welcome, traveller.

***This website is an all-in-one place to find projects I am, or have, working on, the technical experiments I delve into, and the things I simply enjoy, be they in the gaming or technological worlds.***

### About Me
<img align="right" width=200 height=250 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arbiter04032000/xhTech/master/Media/xavier_hancockcrop.jpg"> Xavier Hancock is a heavily technically-minded game designer, practiced in the art of breaking down patterns and puzzles to their core logic, learning the methods of these logics, and then rebuilding them into valuable new designs.<br>

## Projects
### Damnation
_Finished_<br>
_September 2020 - November 2020_<br>
Damnation is a top-down roguelike dungeon crawler, with heavy horror elements and strategic gameplay.<br>
On this project, I served primarily as the technical designer, complementing our more gameplay and sound oriented gameplay designer, as well as our sole programmer. I also served as the lighting and VFX engineer as a secondary role.<br>

### PRJ Starshot
_Coming soon!_<br>
Check back in a few months.

### Magdora-verse
_The perpetual project_<br>
The Magdora-verse project is a hobby writing project, involving writing a fictional universe centered around a location of the same name.<br>
This is a project that has been running since 2016, and so far all public information about it is located [here](https://magdoraverseofficial.fandom.com). Updates to this wiki will come as I feel the information is ready- generally whenever the details are consistent enough for it to make sense.
